Description:

Created a responsive portfolio using HTML and CSS with access to my previous work and contact information for future employers.


    Took Run buddy code and refactored it
    removed steps section
    replaced colors for fonts, backgrounds, button, and hover throughout the LP
    added a background image to the "header and salask" class
    added icons in header which lead to correct areas on the landing page
    renamed classes and ids in html and css
    replaced images in trainers section and used it for my skills and work section
    added a recent photo of myself in the about me section and adjusted the size on the landing page but clickable to be able to view in its actual size
    Updated Media Queries so that it's responsive that adapts to different viewports
